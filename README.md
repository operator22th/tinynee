# tinynee
A compact renderer that implements Next Event Estimation along with a buntch of other interesting features:

The following displays may contain some noise points, as this is just a demonstration rendered with 4 samples per pixel (spp). Increasing the number of samples per pixel will reduce these noise points.

To run the program, download source code of glm from [Here](https://github.com/g-truc/glm/tree/master/glm) and put the forder into "extertals".
